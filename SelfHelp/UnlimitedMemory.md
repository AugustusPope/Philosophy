# Introduction
Imagine if you were born without a memory. Who would you be? You would be nothing; if you don’t have a memory, you don’t have anything else. If I ask you, “Who are you?” you would immediately start rearranging memories in your mind to answer that question. Your memory is the glue that binds your life together; everything you are today is because of your amazing memory. You are a data collecting being, and your memory is where your life is lived. If you didn’t have a memory, you wouldn’t be able to learn, think, have intelligence, create, or even know how to tie your shoes. You wouldn’t be able to build experience in any field because experience is just a collection of memories after all! __Only if you can remember information can you live it.Memory is the corner stone of our existence. It determines the quality of our decisions and, therefore, our entire life!__

When you improve your memory, you improve everything. You can access information more quickly and more easily – creating greater opportunities for connections and associations. The more facts and memories that you have properly stored in your brain, the more potential you have to make unique combinations and connections. An increased memory also enhances basic intelligence because intelligence is based on all of the events, people, and facts that you can recall. The more you remember, the more you can create and do because factual knowledge always precedes skill. Information can only be built onto more information, so the more you know the easier it is to get to know more.

# PART 1. CONCENTRATE

> “The best advice I ever came across on the subject of concentration is: Wherever you are, be there.”
~ Jim Rohn


## Excuse Me
These are the same excuses that you use every time to stop yourself from learning anything new. __You can have success or excuses, but you can’t have them both.__ People that learn quickly only focus on the information and skills that matter – excuses don’t matter, and they are thought viruses. The only things that are keeping you from getting what you want in your life are the excuses you keep telling yourself. Who would you be without your excuses? Think about it. Every excuse you accept makes you weaker. Excuses stop you from concentrating and paying attention. When you excuse yourself from learning something new, you block your focus and your energy. Always remember that __where your attention goes, your energy flows__. Some of the most common excuses that people use to give away their power are:

1. I AM HELPLESS
2. SOMEONE ELSE IS TO BLAME
3. TOO MUCH STRESS

Richard Bach said, "Argue for your limitations and, sure enough, they're yours." The only cause for not doing something with the information in this book is you; nobody else but you. You are responsible for your learning. The person that has the most to do with what happens to you is you! __If you believe your limits, your life will be very limited__.
Improving your memory and concentration is not only about what you need to do more of; it is also about what you need to do less of. It is amazing how quickly you can learn a new skill when you decide to let go of your excuses, judgments, and complaints. If you consistently change your approach and increase your desire to learn this information, you will master it.

TAKE ACTION NOW!
1. If you continue to hold on to your excuses, what would your life be like five years from now?
2. Who would you be without your excuses? Enter all learning with this new mindset.
3. Remember they are just excuses. It is not the truth. Change them now.
4. What is more important to you: excusing yourself from experiencing your potential or being the best that you can be?
5. Why is it important for you to learn to empower your memory? Think about it and write down as many reasons as you can to create a big WHY. As Darren Hardy says, “We need why power not willpower.”

## NEVER BELIEVE A LIE

> “The mind is the limit. As long as the mind can envision the fact that you can do something, you can do it – as long as you believe 100 percent.” ~ Arnold Schwarzenegger

Your beliefs of what your concentration and memory can do may be your own limited version of the truth. Many people never get a taste of their true potential because they have decided to entertain only a limited view of what they can do.

Richard Bandler said, “Beliefs aren’t about truth. Beliefs are about believing. They are guides for our behavior.” We always defend what we believe. If you believe you have a bad memory, you will always act and think in accordance with that belief. Where your attention goes, your energy flows.

__A belief is a sense of being certain and what you believe, you become.__

Negative beliefs and thoughts place a block on your concentration and memory. Unless you decide to take responsibility and change the thoughts that you are constantly feeding yourself, you will not be able to break through your negative conditioning. Every single thought we have is creative: it has the power to build and the power to destroy.

Your beliefs either move you or stop you. In brief, every thought and every word works for you or against you, and every thought that you confirm to be true multiplies and becomes a belief. When you change a belief you change a mental construction and, therefore, your life. In other words, we believe what we have been taught to believe, and we don’t question beliefs because we don’t want to question the source. Begin to ask yourself, “Who will I be doubting by changing my beliefs about my mind, concentration, and memory and why do I think this is true?”

People tend to think that their beliefs are absolutely true, but these beliefs are only true for them. Just because you can’t do something well doesn’t mean it is impossible. Identify your self-limiting beliefs and then ask, “What if they were not true at all?” and remember the limits in your belief system will always stop you from seeing any alternatives that should be obvious.

__Your beliefs are only the stories that you have accepted to be true about yourself… just decide to change the stories.__

Spenser Lord said, “Beliefs are not tattoos, they are just like clothes – you can put them on and take them off at will.” Thus, here are five core beliefs that you can ‘put on’ right now:

1. I WAS BORN WITH EXCEPTIONAL CONCENTRATION AND MEMORY
>  You are already all you need to be. Maxwell Maltz said, “Do not tolerate for a minute the idea that you are prohibited from any achievement by the absence of in-born talent or ability. This is a lie of the grandest order, an excuse of the saddest kind.” You don’t need anything more. You don’t need a special talent or pill to have brilliant concentration or a great memory. All you need is a willingness to learn, a method, and self-discipline.

2. MEMORY IMPROVEMENT IS IMPORTANT
3. I HAVE INCREDIBLE ABILITIES. MY MEMORY IS UNLIMITED
4. THERE IS NO FAILURE, ONLY FEEDBACK
5. I DON'T KNOW IT ALL
