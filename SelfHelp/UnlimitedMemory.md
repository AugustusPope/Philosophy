# Introduction
Imagine if you were born without a memory. Who would you be? You would be nothing; if you don’t have a memory, you don’t have anything else. If I ask you, “Who are you?” you would immediately start rearranging memories in your mind to answer that question. Your memory is the glue that binds your life together; everything you are today is because of your amazing memory. You are a data collecting being, and your memory is where your life is lived. If you didn’t have a memory, you wouldn’t be able to learn, think, have intelligence, create, or even know how to tie your shoes. You wouldn’t be able to build experience in any field because experience is just a collection of memories after all! __Only if you can remember information can you live it.Memory is the corner stone of our existence. It determines the quality of our decisions and, therefore, our entire life!__

When you improve your memory, you improve everything. You can access information more quickly and more easily – creating greater opportunities for connections and associations. The more facts and memories that you have properly stored in your brain, the more potential you have to make unique combinations and connections. An increased memory also enhances basic intelligence because intelligence is based on all of the events, people, and facts that you can recall. The more you remember, the more you can create and do because factual knowledge always precedes skill. Information can only be built onto more information, so the more you know the easier it is to get to know more.

# PART 1. CONCENTRATE

> “The best advice I ever came across on the subject of concentration is: Wherever you are, be there.”
~ Jim Rohn


## Excuse Me
These are the same excuses that you use every time to stop yourself from learning anything new. __You can have success or excuses, but you can’t have them both.__ People that learn quickly only focus on the information and skills that matter – excuses don’t matter, and they are thought viruses. The only things that are keeping you from getting what you want in your life are the excuses you keep telling yourself. Who would you be without your excuses? Think about it. Every excuse you accept makes you weaker. Excuses stop you from concentrating and paying attention. When you excuse yourself from learning something new, you block your focus and your energy. Always remember that __where your attention goes, your energy flows__. Some of the most common excuses that people use to give away their power are:

1. I AM HELPLESS
2. SOMEONE ELSE IS TO BLAME
3. TOO MUCH STRESS

Richard Bach said, "Argue for your limitations and, sure enough, they're yours." The only cause for not doing something with the information in this book is you; nobody else but you. You are responsible for your learning. The person that has the most to do with what happens to you is you! __If you believe your limits, your life will be very limited__.
Improving your memory and concentration is not only about what you need to do more of; it is also about what you need to do less of. It is amazing how quickly you can learn a new skill when you decide to let go of your excuses, judgments, and complaints. If you consistently change your approach and increase your desire to learn this information, you will master it.

TAKE ACTION NOW!
1. If you continue to hold on to your excuses, what would your life be like five years from now?
2. Who would you be without your excuses? Enter all learning with this new mindset.
3. Remember they are just excuses. It is not the truth. Change them now.
4. What is more important to you: excusing yourself from experiencing your potential or being the best that you can be?
5. Why is it important for you to learn to empower your memory? Think about it and write down as many reasons as you can to create a big WHY. As Darren Hardy says, “We need why power not willpower.”

## NEVER BELIEVE A LIE

> “The mind is the limit. As long as the mind can envision the fact that you can do something, you can do it – as long as you believe 100 percent.” ~ Arnold Schwarzenegger

Your beliefs of what your concentration and memory can do may be your own limited version of the truth. Many people never get a taste of their true potential because they have decided to entertain only a limited view of what they can do.

Richard Bandler said, “Beliefs aren’t about truth. Beliefs are about believing. They are guides for our behavior.” We always defend what we believe. If you believe you have a bad memory, you will always act and think in accordance with that belief. Where your attention goes, your energy flows.

__A belief is a sense of being certain and what you believe, you become.__

Negative beliefs and thoughts place a block on your concentration and memory. Unless you decide to take responsibility and change the thoughts that you are constantly feeding yourself, you will not be able to break through your negative conditioning. Every single thought we have is creative: it has the power to build and the power to destroy.

Your beliefs either move you or stop you. In brief, every thought and every word works for you or against you, and every thought that you confirm to be true multiplies and becomes a belief. When you change a belief you change a mental construction and, therefore, your life. In other words, we believe what we have been taught to believe, and we don’t question beliefs because we don’t want to question the source. Begin to ask yourself, “Who will I be doubting by changing my beliefs about my mind, concentration, and memory and why do I think this is true?”

People tend to think that their beliefs are absolutely true, but these beliefs are only true for them. Just because you can’t do something well doesn’t mean it is impossible. Identify your self-limiting beliefs and then ask, “What if they were not true at all?” and remember the limits in your belief system will always stop you from seeing any alternatives that should be obvious.

__Your beliefs are only the stories that you have accepted to be true about yourself… just decide to change the stories.__

Spenser Lord said, “Beliefs are not tattoos, they are just like clothes – you can put them on and take them off at will.” Thus, here are five core beliefs that you can ‘put on’ right now:

1. I WAS BORN WITH EXCEPTIONAL CONCENTRATION AND MEMORY
>  You are already all you need to be. Maxwell Maltz said, “Do not tolerate for a minute the idea that you are prohibited from any achievement by the absence of in-born talent or ability. This is a lie of the grandest order, an excuse of the saddest kind.” You don’t need anything more. You don’t need a special talent or pill to have brilliant concentration or a great memory. All you need is a willingness to learn, a method, and self-discipline.

2. MEMORY IMPROVEMENT IS IMPORTANT
3. I HAVE INCREDIBLE ABILITIES. MY MEMORY IS UNLIMITED
4. THERE IS NO FAILURE, ONLY FEEDBACK
5. I DON'T KNOW IT ALL

## BE HERE NOW
Imagine your attention was an Olympic athlete. Would your athlete be able to be competitive? The reason our attention and focus isn’t that great is because we haven’t trained it. We keep on switching through the channels of our minds and never stop long enough on one specific channel. We pay attention half-heartedly on almost everything we do these days. We live in an activity illusion and think that ‘busyness’ is equal to good business. Busyness is sometimes just procrastination in disguise. Busyness may make you feel good and make you think you are more productive but when we look back at the end of the day we realize we haven’t done anything worthwhile. We are training our minds to have continuous partial attention, and our attention is being fragmented.

Training your concentration isn’t that hard. You just have to learn to become more peaceful and find the moment. You have to learn to be here now. When you are at work, be at work. When you are at home, be at home. “Learn to be silent. Let your quiet mind listen and absorb,” said Pythagoras.

We fill our minds up with all kinds of conflict, and this takes us away from the moment. Have you ever had a fight with someone at home, then you get to work, and the whole day you can’t concentrate? Conflict pulls your mind in many directions; when you fill your mind with conflict, your mind will be all over the place. __Conflict is the opposite of concentration.__

There are four areas that you need to focus on to eliminate conflict and create more peace in your mind:

1. TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR INNER VOICE
2. STOP MULTITASKING
3. KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
4. ELIMINATE WORRY

# PART 2. CREATE AND CONNECT

> "When you train your creativity, you automatically train your memory. When you train your memory, you automatically train your creative thinking skills!" ~ Tony Buzan

## BRING INFORMATION TO LIFE
Think about it... what happens when you read a novel or a story? You make a kind of movie in your mind, don’t you? You can remember all the names of the characters, places, and events because you can see it and you are creating pictures all the time while reading. You are using your imagination and your natural creative ability. However, when people start to learn textbook material they try to make a mental photograph or recording of the page but leave their creative abilities out of the learning process. People that learn quickly or have a so-called photographic memory apply their creativity to everything they learn. They may have either learned how to do this in the past or they have been using the principles naturally and unconsciously.

Most people try to remember information with their sense of sound. They repeat the information over and over again, hoping it will somehow stick. Sound is very limited because it doesn’t attach easily to other memories. A sound is also always sequential; if you want to remember something with sound you have to start at the beginning and work your way through the information. However, when you see information as an image in your mind you can jump in and out of the information, and therefore improve your understanding too.

Any book that you really enjoy normally activates your imagination and brings the information to life. You naturally get engaged in the book and you battle to put it down because you don’t want to turn the ‘movie’ off.

If your brain was unable to make images out of symbols, all learning and reading would be worthless and incredibly boring. Your brain likes pictures and we are really good at remembering them. As neuroscientist John Medina says, “Hear a piece of information and three days later you’ll remember 10% of it. Add a picture and you’ll remember 65%.”

Reading and understanding is also a creative imagination process. It is a power that can be compared to magic. We succeed in this area when we produce images in our mind. When we don’t, we feel confused or ignorant. If I tried to explain to you how a car engine works but you don’t know what an engine looks like or if I didn’t have one for you to look at or a drawing to represent it, it would be really difficult to understand. The more we turn information into images or mind movies, the more we will remember and comprehend. We can learn to make all our learning more creative and memorable if we use our unlimited imagination. You can learn to enhance your memory imagination system by making your mind movies exciting and sticky. The way to do this is with the ‘SEE’ principle.

#### THE SEE PRINCIPLE
Use your __S – Senses__: there are only five ways to get anything into your brain, and that is through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. When you utilize your senses you experience more of life and you remember more.

__E – Exaggeration__: what is easier to remember: a strawberry that is normal size or one the size of a house? Make your images larger or smaller than life. What is more memorable: an elephant or an elephant wearing a pink bikini?

__E – Energize__: give your pictures action. Would you rather watch a movie of your holiday or a slide show? What creates more feeling in your imagination: a horse standing still or a horse that is running and moving?

Some people say, “This is not the way that I naturally think.” This is not the way that I naturally think either; this is how I have taught myself to think, because it works. The more skilled you become in using your imagination the more you can know, comprehend, and create. In this way, you become the director of your own mind.

__The greatest secret of a powerful memory is to bring information to life with your endless imagination.__ Take responsibility for your memory. You can only learn to control your memory when you become the source of your imagination. Memory is not a thing that happens to you; you create your memories. You can make any information into something more meaningful. When we start using the memory systems you will see how easy it is to convert abstract information into meaningful concepts. Using all these memory methods improves your creativity, enhances your memory and your humor too.

## USE YOUR CAR TO REMEMBER

> “Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that’s creativity.” ~ Charles Mingus

Your long-term memory (things that are in your memory forever, like your name and what your house looks like etc.) is like the packet that can be used to trap short-term information (new information coming in, like a new telephone number.) When you have managed to do that, you make a strong medium-term memory (MTM).

With the car list your whole car is in your long-term memory (LTM). LTM offers you a place to store the information. The locations in the car become storage compartments for the short-term memories (STM). All the memory methods work with my formula: LTM + STM = MTM.__The secret to accelerated learning is superior organization.__

## USE YOUR BODY TO REMEMBER

Let me demonstrate how to remember these intelligences with another system. It is called, The Body Method. It is similar to The Car Method, but this time we are using parts of our body to store the new information. Your body is another great long-term storage compartment; you are in it every day and you know it well. There are plenty of storage compartments that you can use, but for demonstration purposes I’m only going to use ten places.

The first place that we are going to store information on is our feet. The first intelligence is Creative intelligence. So I want you to imagine that you are standing on a big bright light bulb (a light bulb always reminds me of creative ideas), and it is burning your feet. To strengthen the association you can also imagine you are painting a beautiful work of art on your feet. On the second place, your knees, we are going to store Personal intelligence. Now imagine a big Purse (sounds like Personal) on your knees. Create a bit of action with this picture; imagine opening the purse on your knees and your knees come flying out of it. Personal intelligence is about taking responsibility, so own the purse on your knees. The next storage compartment is your thighs. Here we will store Social intelligence. Imagine people having a big Party (Social) on your thighs. Really SEE the party and feel it happening on your thighs now. The next place is your belt or hips, and we will store Spiritual intelligence there. Imagine a beautiful angel on your belt, or that the angel is buckling your belt for you (Angels remind me of spirituality). Now review all the previous images from your feet to your hips. The words are Creative, Personal, Social, and Spiritual. Next is your Physical intelligence and we will store it on your stomach. Imagine you get physical, start doing sit ups and your stomach all of a sudden becomes muscular; it becomes the perfect six pack. Imagine in your left hand your Sensual intelligence. Here you can imagine a snotty nose, ears, and eyes to remind you of all of your senses.Then in your right hand place Sexual intelligence – here you can make up your own picture. Now let’s review quickly, we have: Creative, Personal, Social, Spiritual, Physical, Sensual, and Sexual. The next place is your mouth. Imagine big bright colorful numbers flying out of your mouth (Numerical intelligence). Or, you can only speak in numbers. On your nose, SEE a space ship landing on your nose and forehead (Spatial intelligence.) Or, SEE a space ship flying up your nose. Finally, on the top of your head imagine writing words on your hair, or your hair starts talking (Verbal intelligence.)

Let't review The Body List:

The Creative and Emotional Intelligences
(Legs create motion; that is to remind you that the Creative and Emotional intelligences are stored on your feet and legs.)
1. Creative intelligence
2. Personal intelligence (self-knowledge, self-fulfillment, and understanding self)
3. Social intelligence
4. Spiritual intelligence

The Bodily Intelligences
(All stored on the biggest part of your body, on your torso.)
5. Physical intelligence
6. Sensual intelligence
7. Sexual intelligence

The Traditional IQ Intelligences(The head intelligences.)
8. Numerical intelligence
9. Spatial intelligence
10. Verbal intelligence.

The Body Method was originally invented by the ancient Greeks. You can use this method to remember information for exams, work, shopping lists or any list of information. You can even use it to remember things when you don’t have a pen at hand, like when you are in the shower. I just used ten places as an example, but you can use your back, your ears, eyes, nose… you can use it all. Just make sure you connect the two in a humorous way (remember the SEE principles), and that you remember the order.

## PEGGING INFORMATION DOWN


Have you ever had this experience, you smell something and instantly your memory takes you back to another time? The smell is a link to the experience. Or, you hear a song and a whole stream of memories are released from your mind? We can consciously take control of this reminder principle to create another system for our memory skills toolbox. This is the first system that I ever learned, and it introduced me to my memory potential. It worked so well that it seemed like a trick and ever since that day I have been hooked on the power of my memory. I hope it has a similar effect for you. It is called, The Peg Method of memory.
