* Happiness is a state of mind, a choice, a way of living; it is not something to be achieved, it is something to be experienced
* Exercise the body as well as the mind a regular basis. Read daily; remember a reader lives 1000 lives before they die. Gain as much knowledge with it comes power.
* A flower doesn't think of competing with the flower next to it. It just blooms.
* Money solves 90% of your problems.
* Don't buy the latest model in the market. Whether a phone or a computer wait for a couple of months go back to the store and you'll buy the gadget for a fraction.
* In a new job, don’t immediately begin pointing out mistakes and what needs to be changed. Keep your cool, compliment what's working and learn the characters and ranks so you know who to share your ideas with and predict their reaction.
* Ask for a 10% discount in a fixed price store. It's hard and will surprise the attendant but will make you feel more confident.
* Be the first to clap immediately after your boss or colleague makes a keynote speech or presentation. They will love you for it. Everyone craves acceptance by the audience during public speaking, there's always an underlying fear of rejection.
* When giving advice to a teenager, use yourself as an example of how you made wrong choice, the consequences you had to deal with and why you wouldn't like him/her to fall into the same fault.
* If you wanted to ask for business from a prominent person and happen to meet him at supermarket/gym/elevator, don't bring up the issue. Keep the talk social and simple, they'll reward you for it.
* Never speak about other people's bad faults to another. The listener will subconsciously attribute those negative qualities to you.
* Investing in yourself = Loving yourself - Unhappy with yourself? The Franklin shows how you can get to love yourself. The reason people who do favors for you begin to like you is because they’ve invested in you. Their brain makes them defend their investment with good feelings. Use this trick on yourself - DO SOMETHING FOR YOU. Do a favor for yourself: work hard and then go on a vacation. Workout and look good naked and go out in public in a bathing suit. Learn an instrument and make a YouTube video or have friends over and play. The more you invest in yourself, by doing favors for yourself, the more you love yourself.
